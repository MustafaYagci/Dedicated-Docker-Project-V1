Here’s a comprehensive Docker project idea tailored to DevOps professionals, designed to enhance your Docker skills. It includes a source code repository and focuses on deploying a full-stack application.

---

### **Project Title: Multi-Tier Application with Docker**
#### **Description:**
You will containerize, orchestrate, and manage a three-tier web application consisting of:
1. **Frontend**: A React or Angular application.
2. **Backend**: A Python Flask or Node.js API.
3. **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL.

The project will involve creating Dockerfiles for each service, setting up a `docker-compose` file for local development, and deploying the app using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for production.

---

### **Project Goals:**
- Build Docker images for each service.
- Manage multi-container setups with Docker Compose.
- Implement persistent storage for the database.
- Explore Docker networking for service communication.
- Secure images with best practices (e.g., minimal base images).
- Deploy on a container orchestrator (Docker Swarm or Kubernetes).

---

### **Source Code Repository:**
I’ve found a suitable open-source application that you can use for this project. You can clone and modify this repository as needed:

- **Repository**: [Bookstore API on Flask with MySQL](https://github.com/TechPrimers/docker-compose-multi-container-example)
  - **Frontend**: Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript files.
  - **Backend**: Python Flask API.
  - **Database**: MySQL.

#### **Steps to Clone the Repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TechPrimers/docker-compose-multi-container-example.git
cd docker-compose-multi-container-example
```

---

### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**
1. **Containerize Each Service:**
   - Write a `Dockerfile` for the backend (Flask app).
   - Write a `Dockerfile` for the database and set up persistent storage.

2. **Create a `docker-compose.yml`:**
   Define services for:
   - `frontend`
   - `backend`
   - `database`
   Set up environment variables for secure configuration.

3. **Add Networking:**
   Use Docker networks to allow inter-container communication.

4. **Implement Persistent Volumes:**
   Ensure database data persists across container restarts.

5. **Secure Docker Images:**
   - Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size.
   - Scan for vulnerabilities using tools like `trivy`.

6. **Push Images to Docker Hub:**
   - Tag and push your images:
     ```bash
     docker tag <image> <your-dockerhub-username>/<image>:<tag>
     docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/<image>:<tag>
     ```

7. **Deploy Using Docker Swarm:**
   - Initialize a swarm:
     ```bash
     docker swarm init
     ```
   - Deploy the stack:
     ```bash
     docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml myapp
     ```

8. **Optional: Deploy to Kubernetes**
   - Create Kubernetes manifests for deployment, services, and ConfigMaps.

---

### **Skills You'll Practice:**
- Writing optimized Dockerfiles.
- Multi-container orchestration with Docker Compose and Swarm.
- Networking and persistent storage in Docker.
- Securing containerized applications.
- Working with Docker Hub.
- Transitioning to Kubernetes.
