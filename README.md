Hereâ€™s a comprehensive Docker task for a DevOps engineer that incorporates various Docker functionalities such as networks, volumes, Docker Compose, and Docker Swarm. This task simulates a real-world scenario where you deploy a scalable application with a complete CI/CD pipeline.

---

# **Docker DevOps Challenge**

## **Objective**
Deploy a scalable, distributed application using Docker, incorporating networks, volumes, Docker Compose, and Docker Swarm. Simulate a production-like environment for a web application with a database backend.

---

## **Application Overview**
We will use a multi-service application consisting of:
1. **Frontend:** A React-based UI.
2. **Backend:** A Node.js API server.
3. **Database:** A PostgreSQL database.

**Source Code:**  
You can clone the repository containing the source code for these services from:  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/example/docker-devops-challenge)  
*(Replace with an actual or mocked GitHub link if needed.)*

---

## **Task Steps**

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/example/docker-devops-challenge.git
cd docker-devops-challenge
```

### **Step 2: Create Dockerfiles for Each Service**
- **Frontend:** Create a `Dockerfile` in the `frontend/` directory.
- **Backend:** Create a `Dockerfile` in the `backend/` directory.
- **Database:** Use the official PostgreSQL image from Docker Hub.

#### Example Dockerfile (Backend)
```dockerfile
FROM node:16
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### **Step 3: Configure Docker Compose**
Write a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the multi-service architecture.

#### Example `docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    depends_on:
      - backend
    networks:
      - app-network

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@database:5432/mydb
    depends_on:
      - database
    networks:
      - app-network

  database:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - app-network

volumes:
  db-data:

networks:
  app-network:
```

### **Step 4: Test Locally**
1. Build and run the application locally using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
2. Verify the application is running at `http://localhost:8080`.

---

### **Step 5: Prepare for Docker Swarm**
1. **Initialize a Swarm Cluster:**
   ```bash
   docker swarm init
   ```
2. **Convert Compose File for Swarm Deployment:**
   ```bash
   docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml myapp
   ```

### **Step 6: Implement Scaling**
Scale the backend service to handle more traffic:
```bash
docker service scale myapp_backend=3
```

---

### **Step 7: Configure Persistent Data**
Ensure the database volume (`db-data`) retains data even after restarting the container.

### **Step 8: Set Up Networking**
1. Verify the `app-network` is created as an overlay network.
   ```bash
   docker network ls
   ```
2. Test connectivity between services using the `docker exec` command.

---

### **Step 9: CI/CD Pipeline**
Integrate a CI/CD pipeline for the application:
1. Use GitHub Actions (or an equivalent CI/CD tool) to automate the build and push process for Docker images.
2. Write a `Dockerfile` and workflow `.yml` file for the CI/CD pipeline.

---

### **Bonus Task**
- Implement a monitoring solution (e.g., Prometheus + Grafana) to monitor the Docker containers.
- Set up logging using an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) stack.

---

## **Deliverables**
1. Dockerfiles for all services.
2. `docker-compose.yml` file.
3. Documentation on scaling and networking.
4. A GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD.

---

This task touches on most Docker features and DevOps practices, giving you a holistic understanding of Docker's capabilities in a real-world scenario.
